# What is PiBoard
I was bored with my normal calendar and wall clock so I decided to make something special!  
I will try to create an interactive calendar and clock using an upcoming device called [1080Pi](http://www.inti-innovations.co.uk/products/inti-media/inti-media-raspberrypi.html) and Chromium for Raspberry Pi. I'm gonna shere my code here and create a collection on Google+ with updates right after buying the device.

# When do I want to start work?
Well, I'll try to do something in free time but I don't know when will I find and buy the device.
